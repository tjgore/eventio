## Eventio

An event website built with nextjs and contentful cms

### Getting started 

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add your contentful keys

```javascript
npm install 

npm run tailwind // to create main css styles

npm run dev // to start development env

npm run build // to build for production

npm start // to start production server

npx now --name project-name . // to deploy to now. Notice the dot at the end of this command. You may need to run `npx now login` for first time use.
```
